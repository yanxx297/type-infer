Description:
The source code of a type inference research project under construction.

BUILD:
	Run make in type-infer-src/
	The following libraries should be installed before this code can be compiled:
		- Libdwarf: http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html#releases
		- Vine: http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/release/vine-1.0/vine-1.0.tar.gz
  		(VEX and STP is required by and included in Vine; You should also install ocaml package)
		- Boost Graph Library: http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/
	Make sure the paths of libraries and the home path are correctly set. 
	You can set them in type-infer-src/Makefile.variable.

BEFORE RUNNING:
	- For standard libc support, the debug information file of libc must be copy into the same folder of the executable, with "libc-2.15.so" as its name. This file can be find in /usr/lib/debug/lib/i386-linux-gnu for Ubuntu Linux distribution.
	- Before starting the type inference executable (./infer), make sure struct.log is in the same folder.

SYNOPSIS:
	./infer FILENAME [OPTIONS]
	
	-ssaf
		Print out the SSA-formation Vine IR. 
		Graph is printed out only when this option is turned on.
		
	-single FUNCTION_NUMBER
		Analyze a single function, rather than the entire binary.
		The number of each function is available in the printed out results.
		
	-libc
		Print out variables whose type is defined in standard C library.
		Those variables are ignored by default.
