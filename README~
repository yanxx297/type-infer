Description:
The source code of a type inference research project under construction.

Build:
Run make in type-infer-src/
The following libraries should be installed before this code can be compiled:
- Libdwarf: http://dwarfstd.org/
- Vine: http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/release/vine-1.0/vine-1.0.tar.gz
  (VEX is required before installing Vine)
- Boost Graph Library: http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/
Make sure the paths of libraries and the home path are correctly set. 
You can set them in type-infer-src/Makefile.variable.

Running:
For standard libc support, the debug information file of libc must be copy into the same folder of the executable, with "libc-2.15.so" as its name.
This file can be find in /usr/lib/debug/lib/i386-linux-gnu for Ubuntu.
